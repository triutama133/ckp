__label__utilitas Villalonga and Amit (2006) examined the effect of a founder, descendant, and professional chair- man/CEO against family firms value in the US and found that, for both family and non-family firms, a founder CEO and chairman in family firms had This study attempts to provide several significant contributions to the family and IPO literature.
__label__utilitas H3c: Under agency theory, family firms with a family founder chairman of the board have a negative correlation with IPO underpricing.
__label__utilitas H3d: Under agency theory, family firms with a fam- ily descendant chairman of the board have a positive correlation with IPO underpricing.
__label__utilitas Based on the literature review, this paper proposes the following hypotheses: H4d: Under agency theory, family firms with a family chairman have a positive correlation with IPO long-run performance.
__label__utilitas H2b: Under agency theory, family firms with a family chairman of the board have a nega- tive correlation with IPO underpricing.
__label__utilitas H4g: Under agency theory, family firms with a family founder chairman have a positive cor- relation with IPO long-run performance.
__label__utilitas H4h: Under the agency theory, family firms with a family descendant chairman have a negative correlation with IPO long-run performance.
__label__utilitas As shown in equation (5), the main variables of in- terests are DCEOFam and DCOBFam The val- ues of DCEOFam and DCOBFam equal 1 if a family member (regardless she or he is a founder or descendant) sits as the company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Board (COB), respectively.
__label__utilitas DHot Firm size Firm age + + Similarly, to test the hypothesis that the status of family members who are the chairmen of the board affects the long-run IPO performance (H4g and H4h), this study regresses the BHAR on the two main variables of interest ( DCOBFounder ) : and DCOBDescendant BHAR DCOBFounder = + + DCOBDescendant Underpricing + + (12) + .
__label__utilitas The result suggests that having a family member as the chairman of the Board of Commissioners in family firms has no effect on the IPO underpricing.
__label__utilitas This im- plies that investors might not think that having a family member as the chairman of the Board of Commissioners carried out the managerial super- vision role better than a professional chairman.
__label__utilitas Both founder and descendant chairmen of the board in family firms do not have a significant impact on IPO underpricing.
__label__utilitas It is necessary to provide an examination on the turnover of all firm executives together in restatement firms, including the chairman, CEO and fi- nancial executives (refers to management turnover here).
__label__utilitas (2013) document that family members would affect the individual turnover of managers, including the chairman, the CEO and financial executives in forced restatement firms.
__label__utilitas Definition and measurement of variables Management turnover variable (the dependent vari- able) is MTURN, which measures management turnover: the chairman, the CEO and financial ex- ecutives.

__label__utilitas The sample consisted of 341 stu- dents spread throughout Indonesia, while the data was collected using a questionnaire distributed online and analyzed using the Smart-PLS.
__label__utilitas Furthermore, the data were collected using online questionnaires with a Likert scale of 1-5, and the study population was students spread across Indonesia, while the sam- ple was determined using non-probability sam- pling as the population size is not clearly identified.
__label__utilitas while for the variable ≤ 7 the minimum was 150, and ≥7 was 300 (Hair et al., 2014).
__label__utilitas However, there are some limitations, for example, despite using online questionnaires that are massively available for respondents throughout Indonesia, incomplete an- swers due to time constraints are obtained, taking into account the psychology of respondents when filling out question items.

__label__utilitas According to Fan, Wong, and Zhang (2012), a succession takes place when a family member is appointed to the position of chairman and the founder transfers control to the successor.
__label__utilitas In the first five years after replacement of the chairman, cumulative abnormal compensation fell to 56%, but then recovered slightly, which may be related to special assets in family firms (Fan et al., 2008).
__label__utilitas Succession year is de- termined as when the leader retires from the posi- tion of chairman, and the family’s second genera- tion or external professional takes over the posi- tion.
__label__utilitas As mentioned above, succession year represents when the leader retires from the position of chairman, and the family’s second generation or external professional takes over the position.
