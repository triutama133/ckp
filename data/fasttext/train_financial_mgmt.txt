__label__utilitas Brian Houston, Dissertation Chairs ABSTRACT Traditional crisis communication literature emphasizes how organizations can use communication to preserve their image after a negative event.
__label__utilitas Although these strategies can be effective for preserving, repairing, or restoring reputation, applications have lost sight of an organization’s ethical obligation to address how they contributed to the crisis and claim responsibility for their failure to prevent or lessen the effects of the crisis.
__label__utilitas Coombs and Holladay’s (1996) approach to public relations shifts the focus from the violation (i.e., crisis) of social norms to repairing the violation by using communication to lessen the perceived severity of the crisis while enhancing perceptions of the organization.
__label__utilitas It would be contradictory to pair corrective action, which is a necessary response to any crisis, with all reputation management responses, such as denial, silence, excuse, and minimization (Coombs, 2015).
__label__utilitas For instance, if corrective action was incorporated in the base crisis response, there would be potential for corrective action, or the commitment to prevent a similar event, to be paired with a reputation management strategy like an excuse, scapegoating, or minimization.
__label__utilitas This pairing would create an inconsistent message where the organization accepts responsibility while rejecting it in the same response.
__label__utilitas In CSR literature, moral outrage was found to occur when participants perceived greed by the organization and unfair corporate behavior (Antonetti, Paolo & Maklan, 2016).
__label__utilitas From maintaining, restoring, to repairing, scholars have studied different ways to protect reputation in the face of a crisis.

__label__utilitas The effect ranged fairly small (0.09 - 0.30) and the estimate is not very precise.
__label__utilitas These findings illustrate a downfall of efforts that emphasize absolving guilt and repairing image.
__label__utilitas This moral outrage can be the result of stakeholders perceiving the organization as greedy or partaking in unfair or irresponsible behavior (Lindenmeier et al., 2012; Antonetti et al., 2016).
__label__utilitas Alone, the Base response was ineffective at meeting stakeholder needs, but paired with corrective action and organizational learning (BC and BCO), the response was perceived more favorably.
__label__utilitas By shifting efforts on how to identify and prevent future crises, it demonstrates priority is invested in protecting stakeholders, rather than repairing reputation.
__label__utilitas This line of inquiry promotes approaching a crisis as an opportunity, which is consistent with other studies that acknowledge the downfall of an emphasis on absolving guilt and repairing image, such as Ulmer and Sellnow’s (2001) categories of renewal.

__label__utilitas Abstract This chapter argues that we have a duty to reduce and repair human-caused harms to nonhuman animals.
__label__utilitas And for many nonconsequentialists, we should accept this framework so that we can reduce and repair human-caused harms, given our increasing complicity in global harm.
__label__utilitas International surge: Given that the current pandemic has expected patterns of transition between countries (through air traffic and ground transportation), the establishment of international cooperation mechanisms for sharing knowledge and equipment is critical.
__label__utilitas Experiments are performed with the hot air flow rate varied from 65,000.00 to 72,000.00 kg/hr, slurry feed rate ranged from 25.50 to 31.00 ton/hr and atomized pressure ranged from 50.00 to 55.00 bars.
__label__utilitas An increase in hot air flow rate also increases bulk density of Zeolite based detergent powder.
__label__utilitas Energy consumption to powder output ratio decreases with an increasing of the slurry feed rate, hot air flow rate and atomized pressure.
__label__utilitas Regular spending includes the basic requirement life, while lifestyle spending includes spending on a computer, internet, car, cell phone, etc.
__label__utilitas A questionnaire was prepared and the primary data was collected through survey method.
__label__utilitas Research Methodology The data collection is through Structured Questionnaire.
__label__utilitas  The money spend on internet, phones, movies can be utilised for some other investment like buying a home or for education.
__label__utilitas Figure 3: Income spend on mobile phones and internet In the case of money spend on mobile phones and internet males and females who spend less than 200 is 18%.

__label__utilitas Performance on a visual search task was assessed using “big data” from the mobile app Airport Scanner (Kedlin Co.), wherein players serve as airport security screeners searching for prohibited items among allowed items.
__label__utilitas This is an important avenue to explore as it is possible that cognitive impairments could contribute to, or perhaps underlie, the litany of negative health consequences related to DST transitions.
__label__utilitas Data were anonymously collected from players of a publicly available mobile game, Airport Scanner (Kedlin Co., www.airportscannergame.com/airportscanner).
__label__utilitas The primary activity in Airport Scanner was a visual search task wherein players took on the role of an airport security screener and looked for illegal items (i.e., targets) among allowed items (i.e., distractors) in simulated luggage (Figure 1A).
__label__utilitas In the game, players progress through a series of “airports” each containing multiple levels.
__label__utilitas Based on our findings and analysis, we propose a pair of options to retail investors, depending on their time commitment and risk tolerance level.
__label__utilitas When the indicator is less than 50, stock prices are fairly valued; hence, investors prefer to stay with S&P 500 stocks.
__label__utilitas They are not just about fairness but also about being economically efficient.
__label__utilitas Poverty is defined as either growing up in a household that is living on an income below 60% of the median income or in a household that is materially deprived of at least 3 out of 9 things – ranging from not having more than one pair of shoes, not having a warm meal with meat or fish every second day, not having a week of holiday a year to being behind in paying rent and utility bills, or growing up in a household where hardly anybody works.
__label__utilitas In recent years, the Internet has become an infrastructure that ties a wide variety of computers together.
__label__utilitas The Internet highlights the fact that an innovation which began as an experiment can mature to become part of the infrastructure.
__label__utilitas As a division of Research Square Company, we’re committed to making research communication faster, fairer, and more useful.
__label__utilitas Styles often come in natural pairs: stocks with a high value of some characteristic consti- tute one style, and stocks with a low value of the same characteristic, the other.
__label__utilitas In these pair situations, by far the most important competitor for one style is its twin, making the pairwise comparison in (5) more relevant.
__label__utilitas In this paper, we restrict attention to simple cash(cid:13)ow covariance structures where all assets have a cash(cid:13)ow news variance of one, where the pairwise cash(cid:13)ow correlation between any two assets in the same style is the same, and where the pairwise cash(cid:13)ow correlation between any two assets in di(cid:11)erent styles is the same: cov(" ; " ) = 1, i = j; (20) +1 +1 i;t j;t cov(" ; " ) = r , i = j , i; j in the same style, +1 +1 1 i;t j;t cov(" ; " ) = r , i = j , i; j in di(cid:11)erent styles.
__label__utilitas +1 +1 2 i;t j;t 2 In other words, all assets have the same return variance, the pairwise return correlation between any two assets in the same style is the same, and the pairwise return correlation between any two assets in di(cid:11)erent styles is the same.

__label__utilitas This result implies, for example, that the returns on small stocks and large stocks and the returns on value stocks and growth stocks should be pairwise less correlated than their fundamentals.

__label__donasi Fundamentally, this explo- ration of national business systems focuses on static, comparative aspects HANNAH JUN 37 across countries and suggests that distinctive national business systems arise from differences in economic organization at the national level (e.g., Moskalev and Park 2010; Xu and Yang 2010; Jamali and Mirshak 2007).
__label__utilitas Depending on the social screen, this can also be broadened to include issues such as supply chain management (SCM) and fair trade.
__label__utilitas showing a general commitment to investment in the local community and global issues such as fair trade.
__label__utilitas This includes the disclosure of fair trade practices among global coffee makers such as Starbucks, more stringent monitoring of contractors for global textile and sports equipment makers such as Gap and Nike, and the widespread adoption of corporate codes of conduct regarding labor standards, equal opportunity, and diversity.

__label__donasi Specifically, while a growing body of research has examined the potential convergence of CSR as international standardization and repor- ting may reflect a broad alignment of core issues and values with regards to CSR (e.g., Chen and Bouvain 2009; Misani 2010), many scholars (e.g., Jamali HANNAH JUN 45 and Mirshak 2007; Visser 2006, 2008) still note that social agendas are still largely driven by local culture, expectations, and priorities and thus demand further study.

__label__utilitas EMPIRICAL ASSET PRICING – LITERATURE REVIEW23 Professionals and scholars in the field of financial investments have always been keen on the question of how to forecast and interpret the fair expected return of securities reflecting risk24, or, in other words, to predict equity prices25.
__label__utilitas The essence of this anomaly is that the return that small firms can achieve is significantly higher than the risk-adjusted fair (CAPM) return.
__label__utilitas The second way of making contact was utilising business and employment-oriented databases on the internet (i.e., LinkedIn)38.
__label__utilitas However, some recent publications underscore the advantages of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technologies such as Skype (Deakin and Wakefield, 2014; Lo Iacono et al., 2016).
__label__utilitas Nowadays, everything has changed: data feeds and APIs are applied, and users can easily access modern, user-friendly client interfaces on the internet.” As one respondent argued, the greatest challenge has been to collect reliable, good quality data.
__label__utilitas Sustainable investing has at least 50 years of history, as the first related publications of Belkaoui (1976), Bowman and Haire (1975), Bragdon and Marlin (1972), and Moskowitz (1972) appeared in the ‘70s.
__label__utilitas The world’s urban population is expected to surpass 6 billion by 2045; therefore, investments that include home-building, infrastructure construction, civil engineering, air and road transport, and utilities could have immense potential.
__label__utilitas Nevertheless, none of the abnormal returns is significantly different from zero; thus, ESG-themed factor portfolios achieved fair returns, at least, based on the FFC model.
__label__utilitas *** p < 0.01 ** p < 0.05 * p < 0.10 82 In summary, the findings show that most ESG-themed portfolios yielded at least fair returns compared to the benchmark after accounting for risk but before accounting for transactions costs.
__label__utilitas Moreover, this discussion is not new-fangled: the performance measurement of sustainable investing has at least 50 years of history, as the first wave of studies were published in the 1970s (Moskowitz 1972; Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Bowman and Haire 1975)8.
__label__utilitas Finally, Bowman and Haire (1975) introduce an inverted “U” relationship, meaning that only the intermediate level of ESG pays off.
__label__utilitas The inverted U-shaped relation, first described by Bowman and Haire (1975), contends that the intermediate level of ESG performance maximises investor yields.
__label__utilitas This outcome is in line with the original findings of Bowman and Haire (1975) on an inverted U-shaped relationship.
__label__utilitas The question about the fair limits for “social sensitivity versus business efficiency” is no longer an economic issue but rather a moral one.
__label__utilitas Finally, proponents of inverted U-shaped relationship assert that considering non- linearity may be a suitable assumption in many cases (Bowman and Haire, 1965); that is, intermediate levels of ESG performance maximise investor yields.
__label__utilitas The question about the fair limits for “social sensitivity versus business efficiency” is no longer an economic issue but rather a moral one.
__label__utilitas In summary, the dissertation’s most important conclusion is that, in most cases, investors could realise at least fair returns with sustainable investing.
